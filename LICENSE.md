# PROJECT Si-28 LICENSING

**Copyright © 2026 Giuseppe & The Gemini Consensus.**

**Project Si-28 (The Resonant Refinery)** is an open-source hardware project dedicated to the democratization of isotopic silicon production. We believe that fundamental materials for quantum computing should be accessible to all.

To ensure both the freedom of use and the protection of the core intellectual property, this project is governed by the following licenses, identical to the main TTR-RISC-V Architecture framework:
